-As a player, I want to see a virtual keyboard in the gamespace so I know what options I have for letters. 
      -Everytime a guess is made, the letter and/or vowel in the virtual keyboard will fade. 

-As a player, I want to see the open and empty tiles, and have the space filled with the letters I pick(depending if they are correct).
      -The amount of tiles will vary, depending on the word and/or object that needs to be guessed.

-As a player, I want to see how many turns I have left before the body of the man is fully built (will operate as the amount of chances left).
      This count will be displayed by the bodyparts that are added to the noose. 

-As a player, I want to know when I've successfully completed the game!
      -Optional: Add a soundbyte that tells the player they've won!
      -Required: Create a tile that displays that the player won the round!


Stretch goal: 

-As a player, I would like to see the amount of wins I have thus far. Preferably, I want to have it run as a win streak, and the count will reset when I lose.
-As a player, I would like to hear a soundbyte that tells me that my guess was incorrect.
-As a player, I would like to hear a soundbyte that tells me that my guess was correct!
